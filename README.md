# LoFGatekeeper
Lakes of Fire Gate Entry System

Current state:
- MVP uses knockout.js for UI. This needs to be changed to React.
- Need to decide rather to stick with RavenDB or move to another document store.
- UI currently only handles wristband number assignment.
- Occasional bug in the search function. (Didn't have time to investigate at the burn.)
